/**
 * MC-I1.S6 (#848, ADR-0005 §4) — project `system.attention.*` envelopes into
 * the MC attention queue.
 *
 * ## Scoping decision (stated in the PR): FEDERATED attention only.
 *
 * MC already has a LOCAL attention producer: `reconcileAttention`
 * (db/attention-sources.ts), driven by the cockpit refresh loop, derives the
 * open attention set from LOCAL DB state (blocked assignments, stale work items)
 * under its OWN id namespace (`att:block:` / `att:stale:`) and — critically —
 * resolves ONLY items carrying those prefixes ("never touch items produced by
 * other sources"). The cockpit loop ALSO publishes those local deltas as
 * `system.attention.*` envelopes onto the bus.
 *
 * If the projection ingested EVERY `system.attention.*` envelope it would fight
 * the local reconciler two ways:
 *   1. It would re-ingest the loop's OWN published local deltas — a write echo.
 *   2. A federated item under a foreign prefix would never be resolved by the
 *      prefix-scoped local reconciler, and a locally-derived item re-published
 *      by the projection under a different prefix would double-count.
 *
 * So the projection's value is the attention the local loop CANNOT see:
 * **federated attention from peer stacks** arriving on `federated.*` subjects.
 * Local (own-principal) attention stays the cockpit loop's job. The projection:
 *   - ingests ONLY envelopes delivered on a `federated.` subject (the renderer
 *     passes the matched subject; we gate on its prefix),
 *   - stores them under a DISTINCT `att:fed:` id namespace so the local
 *     reconciler's prefix-scoped resolve never touches them and vice-versa,
 *   - NULLs the local FK link targets (`work_item_id` / `session_id`): a peer's
 *     session/work-item ids are not local rows, and the schema FKs would reject
 *     them. The peer `stack_id` is stamped (plain key, no FK) so a multi-stack
 *     view can group federated items by origin.
 *
 * `opened` → upsert open; `resolved` → resolve. Idempotent on the item id.
 * Non-throwing: malformed payloads / non-federated subjects return null.
